  man page.
- Fixed in 'monitorix.cgi' to accept the 'silent' option in PCs graphs.
- Fixed to LINE2 type the lines plotted in the Greylisting zoomed graph.


2.0.0  - 01-Feb-2011
====================
This new version is a complete rewrite, including new features and graphs,
cleaned up all the code, updated and enhanced a number of aspects in some
graphs, and fixed a lot of bugs. The most important change is that it no longer
requires 'crond' to work, instead Monitorix is now a complete standalone Perl
daemon being started and stopped like any other system service.

Please read the 'News' and 'Features' sections in the Monitorix web site to
give you an idea of all the changes and new features that include.

I want to give a huge thanks to the people that has contributed testing and
reporting bugs during its beta phase.


1.5.2  - 18-Nov-2010
====================
- Added an new alert based on the usage of the root filesystem. It follows
  the same logic than the CPU alert, so the alert script is practically the
  same.
	(thanks to Ramchander, ramchan10 AT gmail.com)
- Modified the man page of the configuration file to reflect the new alert
  capability.
- Added a protection mechanism when collecting the filesystem disk usage. It
  prevents possible timeout scenarios on those filesystems mounted using NFS.
	(thanks to Ramchander, ramchan10 AT gmail.com)
- Fixed to remove the netmask suffix when collecting the network traffic if
  the IP belongs to a hostname instead of a network.
	(anonymous contribution)

- Changed the default value of rigid (RIGID = 2) to 0 in all network port graphs.
- Included a number of necessary adjustments in the install.sh script to adapt
  it better to the FreeBSD installation process.
	(thanks to Michael Brune, admin AT mjbrune.org)
- Added the description of the @NET_RIGID and @NET_LIMIT arrays in the man page
  monitorix.conf(5).

  showing correctly the graph on systems with some interrupts numbers greater
  than 256.
	(thanks to Dimitri Yioulos, dyioulos AT firstbhph.com)
- Fixed the Memory graph to display correctly the value in MB. This bug affected
  only the FreeBSD systems.
- Fixed to be able to enable only the LAN devices monitoring without having to have
  enabled the network ports monitoring.
	(thanks to Niklas Janzon, niklas.janzon AT gmail.com)
- Fixed the iptables rules section in order to avoid its execution on FreeBSD
  systems.

  that prevented seeing the rest of graphs.
  	(thanks to Robin Friedrich, Robin.Friedrich AT itt.com)


1.4.0  - 05-Oct-2009
====================
- Optimized the iptables command used to collect Chain statistics.
- Added the ability to show the results in plain text instead of using rendered
  graphs. This will make life easier either for people with vision impairments
  and for automatic processing of the information.

  mail log file of each Operating System. This removes the old path hard coded.
- Changed the "use" line of the LWP::UserAgent module, now is only loaded if
  Nginx statistics are enabled. This creates less dependences for all people
  that don't need the Nginx statistics.
- Optimized the accounting process of SSH connections using the same code for
  Linux and for FreeBSD. Linux SSH connections using public keys are also
  counted now.
  	(thanks to Markus Rennings, mren AT mrmx.de)
- Rewritten the Monitorix init script for Gentoo Linux.
  	(thanks to Markus Rennings, mren AT mrmx.de)
- Added a zero pading in the name of the proc.png files.

  umounted, instead of returning the same disk usage of its parent filesystem.
- Fixed the %HTTP_LOG path in the monitorix.conf file for Linux-Gentoo.
  	(thanks to Markus Rennings, mren AT mrmx.de)
- Fixed the missing monitorixico.png file in the install script.
  	(thanks to Markus Rennings, mren AT mrmx.de)
- Fixed to not create the network ports counters if $ENABLE_PORT is "N".

  	(thanks to Aleksandr Miroshnychenko, al.miroshnychenko AT gmail.com)
- Removed the unused $EMAIL option. The $PC_DEFMAIL option is the one used when
  sending the monthly reports.
- Removed the $PC_MAX option as its value is now hard coded.
- Reorganized a bit the monitorix.conf file and cleared the syntax.

	(thanks to Alessandro Soraruf, soraruf AT ntd.homelinux.org)


1.2.3  - 14-Jan-2009
====================
- Fixed the way how Monitorix creates the iptables rules. Now it uses the
  parameter -I instead the -A in order to insert those rules in the top of
  each chain so the data get recorded.
  	(thanks to Andrei Ioachim, andrei AT inteligis.com)
- Added support for the Postfix MTA in the SMTP counter of the Network Services
  Demand graph.
  	(thanks to Andrei Ioachim, andrei AT inteligis.com)
- Fixed a typo in the declaration of $HTDOCS in the install.sh that only
  affected to Gentoo installations.
	(thanks to Carlos Perez, cpa.admin AT gmail.com)
- Removed the dependence of the 'lockfile' command in the init-script.
	(suggested by Carlos Perez, cpa.admin AT gmail.com)
- Fixed to detect and show better the interrupt names.
- Added a minimal support for interrupt numbers bigger than 255. This minimal
  support will let you see the names of those interrupts that have those big
  numbers but their activity will rest still void.
	(thanks to Brian Lopeman, brian.lopeman AT ctrh.org)
- Fixed a missing '127.0.0.1' in the URL of the graph images when
  'monitorix.cgi' is called from the command line.
  	(thanks to David Tiberio, dave AT cheapbooks.com)

====================
- Fixed a missing '/' when removing /var/www/monitorix in the un_install.sh
  script.
	(thanks to Tamas Marki, tamas AT gnsdm.com)
- Fixed to really accept more than three network devices. There were some parts
  that were not correctly upgraded to five.
        (thanks to Milos Prudek, prudek AT bvx.cz)
- Added the parameter -w during the hddtemp call just to make sure that it will
  awaken the disk (if needed).
- Removed the .sh extension and the she-bang in the crond script for all Linux
  distributions, although only in the Debian based ones people experienced
  problems.
- Added a new configuration option to disable the crond mail related to
  Monitorix errors.
	(suggested by Detlef Neubauer, detlef.neubauer AT wzrz.de)
- Fixed to include the "Linux-Generic" as a supported OSTYPE.
- Fixed to include the monthly report files for the Italian language in the RPM
  package.
- Removed the htmlentity of the ampersand character introduced in the previous
  version, as the last RRDtool version seems not complaining anymore.

  not appears in /proc/diskstats and the only way to collect the i/o values is
  using the partition device name.
	(thanks to Travis Wu, twu AT capitalsystems.com)
- Added support for Linux software RAID devices of the form /dev/md/*.
	(thanks to an anonymous IRC user called 'emilio')
- Added Italian language support in the monthly traffic report.
	(thanks to Luca Ferrario, luca AT ferrario.net)
- Fixed the ampersand character to be an entity to avoid complaining messages
  of Pango in the RRDtool 1.3 version.
- Included the "Linux-Generic" OSTYPE key that for a strange reason it was
  missing.
- Fixed in the cover web page to only include the graphs that the system can
  really offer. That will avoid to see more ethernets graphs than the number
  of real ethernet devices and the same for the number of processors.


1.2.0  - 02-Apr-2008
====================
- Added support for systems based on LVM structure on top of a CCISS RAID of
  disk drives.
	(thanks to Bob McClure, Jr., bob AT bobcatos.com)
- Removed the full path of the 'pvs' command as it complicates the portability
  of Monitorix to other Linux distributions.
	(thanks to Eric, teknologist AT gmail.com)
- Added the "no warnings" pragma to temporarily block warnings while calling
  the 'sensors' command.
- Fixed a bug introduced in the last version that prevented to see the interrupt
  names on systems with 2.4 Linux kernels.
- Fixed the graph of disk temperatures in order to preserve the page layout
  when there's no defined any disk device in the HDDTEMP_LIST array.
	(thanks to Eric, teknologist AT gmail.com)
- Fixed to tolerate if @HDDTEMP_LIST was badly defined with just a void entry
  instead of no entries at all. That's if someone defined incorrectly the array
  as @HDDTEMP_LIST = ""; instead of simply as @HDDTEMP_LIST;
	(thanks to Eric, teknologist AT gmail.com)
- Removed the error messages when it has been defined in /etc/monitorix.conf a
  network interface that it doesn't exist in the system.
- Fixed the error message "Use of uninitialized value in string eq at
  /var/www/cgi-bin/monitorix.cgi line 454." that appeared in the Apache error
  logs when using Multihost feature.


1.1.2  - 25-Feb-2008
====================
- Added the execution of the "pvs -a" command each time Monitorix is restarted,
  just to make sure to remove a strange message about "Medium not found"
  appeared on fresh CentOS 5 installations using LVM.
- Converted automatically into a link the URL that appears in the bottom of
  each graph (if enabled by $MULTIHOST_FOOTER) in the Multihost mode.
- Fixed to put the zero character instead of NULL when there's no value, in the
  monthly file of traffic during the daily collecting of counters.
- Fixed a bug in the interrupt names that removed its first character affecting
  only (mostly old) machines with "local-APIC-edge" support.


1.1.1  - 16-Nov-2007
====================
- Fixed a stupid bug that prevented showing the graphs of network ports.

  on, this graph will show its data in a more accurated way than before. People
  can continue using the Real and Stacked modes though.
	(thanks to Christian Meusel, christian.meusel AT inf.tu-dresden.de)
- Definitely fixed (I really hope so) a persistent bug during the numeric
  extraction of the alpha numeric string of the lm_sensors temperatures.
- Fixed support for HP ML310 ProLiant server in the motherboard temperatures
  graph.
- Changed the main page form method from POST to GET in order to be able to
  remove the old /cgi-bin/monitorix.cgi and call localhost.cgi directly.
  So now on, the localhost.cgi is renamed as monitorix.cgi and it's placed in
  the same place where it was the old one, removing the /cgi-bin/monitorix
  directory as it will not longer be used.
- Fixed to show the graph when using multihost feature and select only the
  Context Switches graph.
- Improved how are showed the images when using multihost feature selecting
  only individual hosts. Now they are bigger.


1.0.1  - 03-Oct-2007
====================
- Fixed some annoying messages like "Argument "+46M-BM-0C" isn't numeric in int 
  at /usr/bin/monitorix.pl line > 2710, <SENSORS> line 13.". Now it extracts
  correctly numbers from an alpha numeric string.
	(thanks to Russell Morris, rmorris AT rkmorris.us)
- Changed from area-based to line-based the HP IPL temperature graphs in order
  to follow the same aspect than the new LM-Sensors graph.
- Added a permanent "lower-limit=0" in the following graphs: Context Switches,
  LM-Sensors, Network Packet Traffic and Network Error Traffic.
- Fixed the alignment of the legend in the FAN speeds graph on systems still
  using the old RRDtool branch version 1.0.


1.0.0  - 04-Sep-2007
====================
- Added a new graph to see the temperatures of the system motherboard, CPUs,
  fan speeds and hard disk drives using lm_sensors and the hddtemp tool. Such
  graph is disabled by default since there are still a lot of motherboards with
  unsupported sensors out there. This new graph can be combined with the HP
  specific temperatures graph.
- Fixed some adjustments in the temperatures collector in newer HP ProLiant
  servers with newer IML.
- Added the ability to select the percentages layout in the Kernel Usage
  statistics. The possible options are (R)eal or (S)tacked.
	(suggested by Andrzej Pokrywko, Andrzej.Pokrywko AT onet.pl)
- Fixed a bug that prevented to display correctly the interrupt names on newer
  systems that use PCI-MSI instead of IO-APIC.

  error_log.


0.9.2  - 12-Jun-2007
====================
- Special Debian contribution.

	(thanks to Uwe Heidrich, uweheidrich AT hotmail.com)
- Added support for systems using Linux RAID systems under LVM.
- Fixed in the localhost.cgi and in monitorix.pl files to not include a second
  configuration file if the first one already exists.
- Fixed the graphs legend lines adding blank lines in order to have a better
  formatting. That only affected those who have RRDtool version above 1.2.13.
- Added the Zoom feature that, when enabled, it will permits to see a larger
  picture just clicking inside any graph image.
	(suggested by Dimitri Yioulos, dyioulos AT firstbhph.com)

- Added a new composed-graph to see the Linux kernel usage per processor. The
  graph will be divided by three parts (as always) only using, right now, the
  biggest and the first one of the last two. The graph will show the global
  percentages of total user time, nice time, system time, idle time and io-wait
  time and separately, the number of context switches. Finally if the system
  has multiprocessors there will be an individual graph per processor showing
  the percentages of its CPU times (up to 8 processors).
	(suggested by Michael Berger, MBerger AT scrippsops.com)
- Added a configuration switch (Y/N) per graph to enable or disable its
  processing. This will help specially on embedded systems (where there is not
  much disk space) to monitorize only what it is really needed.
- IMPORTANT NOTICE: The configuration file (/etc/monitorix.conf) has been
  extended with important changes.


0.8.3  - 16-Oct-2006

  APIC feature in newer Linux systems. The "int.rrd" database will be upgraded
  automatically.
- Because of the new support for so many interrupts, the interrupt graphs no
  longer displays the unused ones.
- Added support for up to 5 NICs. The "net.rrd" database will be upgraded
  automatically.
  	(suggested by Mike Harris, MikeDawg AT addictz.org)
- Removed the use of the generation number from the HP ProLiant servers, because
  there are no differencies In the number of processors between the current
  generations. Now the server names are changed from ML350G3 to simply ML350.
