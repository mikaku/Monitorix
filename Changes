  not appears in /proc/diskstats and the only way to collect the i/o values is
  using the partition device name.
	(thanks to Travis Wu, twu AT capitalsystems.com)
- Added support for Linux software RAID devices of the form /dev/md/*.
	(thanks to an anonymous IRC user called 'emilio')
- Added Italian language support in the monthly traffic report.
	(thanks to Luca Ferrario, luca AT ferrario.net)

  of Pango in the RRDtool 1.3 version.
- Included the "Linux-Generic" OSTYPE key that for a strange reason it was
  missing.
- Fixed in the cover web page to only include the graphs that the system can
  really offer. That will avoid to see more ethernets graphs than the number
  of real ethernet devices and the same for the number of processors.


1.2.0  - 02-Apr-2008
====================
- Added support for systems based on LVM structure on top of a CCISS RAID of
  disk drives.
	(thanks to Bob McClure, Jr., bob AT bobcatos.com)

  instead of no entries at all. That's if someone defined incorrectly the array
  as @HDDTEMP_LIST = ""; instead of simply as @HDDTEMP_LIST;
	(thanks to Eric, teknologist AT gmail.com)
- Removed the error messages when it has been defined in /etc/monitorix.conf a
  network interface that it doesn't exist in the system.
- Fixed the error message "Use of uninitialized value in string eq at
  /var/www/cgi-bin/monitorix.cgi line 454." that appeared in the Apache error
  logs when using Multihost feature.


1.1.2  - 25-Feb-2008
====================
- Added the execution of the "pvs -a" command each time Monitorix is restarted,
  just to make sure to remove a strange message about "Medium not found"
  appeared on fresh CentOS 5 installations using LVM.
- Converted automatically into a link the URL that appears in the bottom of
  each graph (if enabled by $MULTIHOST_FOOTER) in the Multihost mode.
- Fixed to put the zero character instead of NULL when there's no value, in the
  monthly file of traffic during the daily collecting of counters.
- Fixed a bug in the interrupt names that removed its first character affecting
  only (mostly old) machines with "local-APIC-edge" support.


1.1.1  - 16-Nov-2007
====================
- Fixed a stupid bug that prevented showing the graphs of network ports.


1.1.0  - 15-Nov-2007
====================
- Added support for Gentoo Linux distribution.
	(thanks to Matej Povazaj, ybdaba AT gmail.com)
- Added support for Slackware Linux distribution.
	(thanks to Bogdan Radulescu, from http://nimblex.net>
- Changed the way how is the data collected in the Kernel Usage graph. From now
  on, this graph will show its data in a more accurated way than before. People
  can continue using the Real and Stacked modes though.
	(thanks to Christian Meusel, christian.meusel AT inf.tu-dresden.de)
- Definitely fixed (I really hope so) a persistent bug during the numeric
  extraction of the alpha numeric string of the lm_sensors temperatures.
- Fixed support for HP ML310 ProLiant server in the motherboard temperatures
  graph.
- Changed the main page form method from POST to GET in order to be able to
  remove the old /cgi-bin/monitorix.cgi and call localhost.cgi directly.
  So now on, the localhost.cgi is renamed as monitorix.cgi and it's placed in
  the same place where it was the old one, removing the /cgi-bin/monitorix
  directory as it will not longer be used.
- Fixed to show the graph when using multihost feature and select only the
  Context Switches graph.
- Improved how are showed the images when using multihost feature selecting
  only individual hosts. Now they are bigger.


1.0.1  - 03-Oct-2007
====================
- Fixed some annoying messages like "Argument "+46M-BM-0C" isn't numeric in int 
  at /usr/bin/monitorix.pl line > 2710, <SENSORS> line 13.". Now it extracts
  correctly numbers from an alpha numeric string.
	(thanks to Russell Morris, rmorris AT rkmorris.us)
- Changed from area-based to line-based the HP IPL temperature graphs in order
  to follow the same aspect than the new LM-Sensors graph.
- Added a permanent "lower-limit=0" in the following graphs: Context Switches,
  LM-Sensors, Network Packet Traffic and Network Error Traffic.
- Fixed the alignment of the legend in the FAN speeds graph on systems still
  using the old RRDtool branch version 1.0.


1.0.0  - 04-Sep-2007
====================
- Added a new graph to see the temperatures of the system motherboard, CPUs,
  fan speeds and hard disk drives using lm_sensors and the hddtemp tool. Such
  graph is disabled by default since there are still a lot of motherboards with
  unsupported sensors out there. This new graph can be combined with the HP
  specific temperatures graph.
- Fixed some adjustments in the temperatures collector in newer HP ProLiant
  servers with newer IML.
- Added the ability to select the percentages layout in the Kernel Usage
  statistics. The possible options are (R)eal or (S)tacked.
	(suggested by Andrzej Pokrywko, Andrzej.Pokrywko AT onet.pl)
- Fixed a bug that prevented to display correctly the interrupt names on newer
  systems that use PCI-MSI instead of IO-APIC.
- Added the ability to change the refresh rate value in the statistics web
  page. The default value remains unchanged to 150 seconds.
- Added some adjustments in the Monitorix init script.
- Extended the environment variable PATH to cover more root directories.
- Changed the default NET_RIGID from 2 to 0.
- Changed the default network configuration from two interfaces to only one, as
  it seems the most of people have only one network interface installed.
- Removed some "Use of uninitialized value ..." annoying messages in the Apache
  error_log.


0.9.2  - 12-Jun-2007
====================
- Special Debian contribution.
  + Added support for Debian distribution.
  + Added the missing "monitorixico.png" file during the install process using
    the install.sh shell-script.
	(thanks to Uwe Heidrich, uweheidrich AT hotmail.com)
- Added German language support in the monthly report.
	(thanks to Uwe Heidrich, uweheidrich AT hotmail.com)
- Added support for systems using Linux RAID systems under LVM.
- Fixed in the localhost.cgi and in monitorix.pl files to not include a second
  configuration file if the first one already exists.
- Fixed the graphs legend lines adding blank lines in order to have a better
  formatting. That only affected those who have RRDtool version above 1.2.13.
- Added the Zoom feature that, when enabled, it will permits to see a larger
  picture just clicking inside any graph image.
	(suggested by Dimitri Yioulos, dyioulos AT firstbhph.com)
- Removed the degree symbol in all the temperature graphs.
- Some little code cleanup.


0.9.1  - 09-Jan-2007
====================

0.9.0  - 03-Jan-2007
====================
- Fixed the background color of the graphs in Multihost feature.
- Added a lot of new colors to cover as many hardware interrupts as they exist.
- Added the Monitorix shortcut icon.
- Fixed a bad closing in the global <html> tag.
- Fixed and optimized the start routine in the init script.
- Added a new composed-graph to see the Linux kernel usage per processor. The
  graph will be divided by three parts (as always) only using, right now, the
  biggest and the first one of the last two. The graph will show the global
  percentages of total user time, nice time, system time, idle time and io-wait
  time and separately, the number of context switches. Finally if the system
  has multiprocessors there will be an individual graph per processor showing
  the percentages of its CPU times (up to 8 processors).
	(suggested by Michael Berger, MBerger AT scrippsops.com)
- Added a configuration switch (Y/N) per graph to enable or disable its
  processing. This will help specially on embedded systems (where there is not
  much disk space) to monitorize only what it is really needed.
- IMPORTANT NOTICE: The configuration file (/etc/monitorix.conf) has been
  extended with important changes.


0.8.3  - 16-Oct-2006
====================
- Added the word "easier" to the Monitorix slogan.
- Added support for CCISS Compaq RAID driver under 2.6 Linux kernels.

  to the Hewlett-Packard server models.
- Fixed a broken image in the third temperature graph on some Hewlett-Packard
  server models.
- Added support for up to 255 hardware interrupts to take advantatge of the
  APIC feature in newer Linux systems. The "int.rrd" database will be upgraded
  automatically.
- Because of the new support for so many interrupts, the interrupt graphs no
  longer displays the unused ones.
- Added support for up to 5 NICs. The "net.rrd" database will be upgraded
  automatically.
  	(suggested by Mike Harris, MikeDawg AT addictz.org)
- Removed the use of the generation number from the HP ProLiant servers, because
  there are no differencies In the number of processors between the current
  generations. Now the server names are changed from ML350G3 to simply ML350.
