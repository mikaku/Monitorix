.SH NAME
monitorix.conf \- Configuration file for Monitorix.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool designed to monitor as many services and system resources as possible. It has been created to be used on production Linux/UNIX servers, but due to its simplicity and small size may also be used to monitor embedded devices as well.
.P
It consists mainly of two programs: a collector, called \fBmonitorix\fP, which is a Perl daemon that is started automatically like any other system service, and a CGI script called \fBmonitorix.cgi\fP. Since 3.0 version Monitorix includes its own HTTP server built in, so you don't need to install any web server to use it.
.P
Every time \fBmonitorix\fP is started it reads the configuration file from the path specified in the command line (using the \fB-c\fP option), and once checked, it creates the \fIindex.html\fP file that will act as the Monitorix main page.
.P
It also creates a file called \fI<base_dir>/cgi/monitorix.conf.path\fP that includes the absolute path of the configuration file. This file will be read by \fBmonitorix.cgi\fP to determine the exact location of the configuration file.
.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
Blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before and after a token or value is ignored as well as tabulators, although a value can contain whitespace within. Lines which begin with a # are considered comments and ignored.
.P
If you want to comment out a large block you can use C-style comments. A /* signals the begin of a comment block and the */ signals the end of the comment block.
.P
If an option has multiple values their must be separated by comma.
.P
.BI title
.RS
A free description of the server; where it is located, the Company name, etc.
.P
Default value: \fIPlace a Title Here\fP
.RE
.P
.BI hostname
.RS
The name of the host.
.P
Default value: 
.RE
.P
.BI theme_color
.RS
RRDtool comes with a default white theme, and since Monitorix introduces its own black theme, you have two predefined themes to choose from.
.P
Default value: \fIblack\fP
.RE
.P
.BI refresh_rate
.RS
The refresh rate (in seconds) of the statistics web page displayed in your browser. If set to 0, page refreshing is disabled.
.P
Default value: \fI150\fP
.RE
.P
.BI iface_mode
.RS
The interface mode defines the manner in which data is shown in the browser. Since version 1.4.0 it has been possible to display the graphic data using plain text tables. This allows Monitorix to be used by those running screen reader software, and also simplifies automatic data processing through scripts.
.P
The possible values are:
.RS
\fIgraph\fP  for rendered graphs.
.br
\fItext\fP   for plain text representation.
.RE
.P
Default value: \fIgraph\fP
.RE
.P
.BI enable_zoom
.RS
Zoom allows double clicking any graph in order to see a larger version (zoomed in). This is especially useful for seeing additional detail.
.P
Default value: \fIy\fP
.RE
.P
.BI netstats_in_bps
.RS
This option toggles network values between bits (bps) and Bytes (Bps) per second. By default the values will be shown in Bytes per second (Bps).
.P
Default value: \fIn\fP
.RE
.P
.BI disable_javascript_void
.RS
This option enables or disables the use of javascript:void-URLs when opening windows with zoomed graphs. Some people likes to open links in the background by pressing the middle mouse button in Firefox, and with the default javascript:void-URLs the only they get is an empty window with nothing in it.
.P
Default value: \fIn\fP
.RE
.P
.BI temperature_scale
.RS
This option toggles between values in Celsius or in Fahrenheit in those graphs that represent temperatures.
.P
The possible values are:
.RS
\fIc\fP  for Celsius.
.br
\fIf\fP  for Fahrenheit.
.RE
.P
Default value: \fIc\fP
.RE
.P
.BI show_gaps
.RS
This option, when enabled, shows the gaps (missing data) in the graphs. This is specially useful to detect if the server or Monitorix were stopped for a while, or any other unavailability.
.P
In order to be able to locate those gaps easily in each graph, it uses the white color in the default black theme and the black color in the white theme. These default colors are defined in \fImonitorix.conf\fP so they can be changed as any other option.
.P
Default value: \fIn\fP
.RE
.P
.BI global_zoom
.RS
This option zooms all the graphs (including the legend's font size) by the given amount. The factor must be greater than 0 and it accepts decimal values.
.P
This is specially useful for people with big screens that either want to avoid using the browser feature to zoom the contents of the window and for those that watch the graphs from certain distance.
.P
Keep in mind that the contents of the graphs remains with the same detail level all the time, and that it doesn't affects to the standard zoomed graph that appears when clicking in the picture.
.P
Default value: \fI1\fP
.RE
.P
.BI max_historic_years
.RS
This option defines the maximum number of years of historical data in all graphs.
.P
WARNING: Every time this value is extended Monitorix will resize every \fI.rrd\fP file accordingly, removing all historical data.
.P
There is no longer any upper limit for this value.
.P
Default value: \fI1\fP
.RE
.P
.BI accept_selfsigned_certs
.RS
This option forces to accept self-signed certificates when collecting values remotely using HTTPS protocol.
.P
Default value: \fIy\fP
.RE
.P
.BI priority
.RS
Sometimes when a server is under heavy use, Monitorix might be unable to collect some statistical data due to its normal priority (0 by default). This makes monitoring useless because graphs are empty during that hard period of time.
.P
In order to mitigate this situation this option sets the priority in which Monitorix will be scheduled by the kernel. The accepted range of values is the same as in the \fIsetpriority()\fP system call: that is, from -20 (maximum priority) to 19 (lowest priority).
.P
Default value: \fI0\fP
.RE
.P
.BI image_format
.RS
This is the format of each generated graph. There are only two possible values: 
\fIPNG\fP and \fISVG\fP.
.P
Default value: \fIPNG\fP
.RE
.P
.BI include_dir
.RS
The main configuration file is usually called \fImonitorix.conf\fP and its location is provided as part of the command line arguments. In addition, other configuration files may be loaded placing them in the directory pointed by this option. The names must end with .conf to be included.
.P
This option is mainly intended to include third-party modules with their own configuration files without having to modify any file from your Monitorix installation. All modules are located in \fI/usr/lib/monitorix\fP (in some operating systems that path can change).
.P
All the configuration files in there will be loaded in alphabetic order, so the last file loaded will overwrite any previous option.
.P
Default value: \fI/etc/monitorix/conf.d\fP
.RE
.P
.BI ip_default_table
.RS
This option will define in which table Monitorix will put all \fIiptables\fP rules for network traffic accounting monitoring. It only works on Linux.
.P
Although this is a global option, only the graphs \fIport\fP, \fInginx\fP and \fItraffacct\fP are affected by it.
.P
Default value: \fIfilter\fP
.RE
.P
.BI ipv6_disabled
.RS
This option enables or disables the use of the \fIip6tables\fP command. It only works on Linux.
.P
Although this is a global option, only the graph \fIport\fP is currently affected by it.
.P
Default value: \fIn\fP
.RE
.P
.BI url_prefix_proxy
.RS
This option forces \fImonitorix.cgi\fP to bypass the URL building. This is specially usefull when Monitorix is used behind a reverse proxy.

.P
Default value:
.RE
.P
.BI enable_hourly_view
.RS
This option enables or disables the ability to select the hourly view in the main page.
.P
No .rrd file will change by selecting this option and the historical data won't be affected.
.P
Default value: \fIn\fP
.RE
.P
.BI user_agent_id
.RS
This option defines the string to be used to identify Monitorix in the HTTP requests. Its value will be sent as the "User-Agent" header.
.P

.br
	- Otherwise, access will be denied when an IP address matches an entry in the \fBhosts_deny\fP list.
.br
	- Otherwise, access will be granted.
.P
Default value: 
.RE
.P
.BI hosts_allow
.RS
This is the opposite of \fBhosts_deny\fP option. IP addresses listed here are permitted to access Monitorix graphs. There is also the special keyword called \fIall\fP that can be used to allow access to all IP addresses.
.P
Default value: 
.RE
.P
.BI https_url
.RS
This will force to use the prefix \fIhttps://\fP in all links. This is special useful if you plan to use a reverse-proxy HTTPS server in front of the Monitorix built-in HTTP.
.P
Default value: n
.RE
.SS Built-in HTTP server with access authentication
.BI enabled
.RS
This enables or disables the authentication mechanism to control access to pages and other resources. The only allowed mechanism is Basic and uses the 401 status code and the WWW-Authenticate response header.
.P
It's highly recommended to set this option according your needs before start Monitorix.
.P
For more information about the Basic access authentication mechanism and its security implications, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication.
.P
Default value: \fIn\fP

.P
Default value: \fIMonitorix: Restricted access\fP
.RE
.P
.BI htpasswd
.RS
This option sets the path to the password file that was created with the help of the \fIhtpasswd.pl\fP script. That script encrypts and validates passwords using the system's crypt() routine. If your Monitorix package doesn't come with that script, you may use the similar \fIhtpasswd\fP(1) program provided with the Apache web server.
.P
The format of the password file consist of one or more lines with a username and password separated by a colon.
.P
The following is an example of a password file:
.P
paul:oGkEsQK6RYIII
.br
peter:HF1r7qRL4Kg6E
.P
Since the script uses the crypt() algorithm, only the first 8 characters of the password are used to form the password. If the supplied password is longer, the extra characters will be silently discarded.
.P
WARNING: don't use the character colon ':' as part of your name or password since this character is used as field separator.
.P
Default value: \fI/var/lib/monitorix/htpasswd\fP

You may define here up to \fBmax\fP network port numbers. If you need to monitor the same network port with TCP and UDP protocols, you can add your own suffix to the port number (e.g: 443t and 443u) in order to distinguish it from the double definition in the <desc> block.

This is the option where each network port specified in \fBlist\fP is described. Each port definition consists of five parameters separated by comma: the port description, the network protocol (\fItcp\fP or \fIudp\fP), the connection type (\fIin\fP, \fIout\fP or \fIin/out\fP) and the rigid and limit values.

There is also support (Linux only) for IPv6 network ports activity by using protocol names as \fItcp6\fP or \fIudp6\fP.

When using the \fIsocket\fP type the network port is, of course, irrelevant but its field is still mandatory. This means that you must respect the three comma-separated values.
.P
Some of the values shown in the graphs are the result of a calculation of two values from either \fISHOW [GLOBAL] STATUS\fP or \fISHOW VARIABLES\fP. The following is an explanation of them:
.P
\fBThread Cache Hit Rate\fP
.br
\fB(1 - (Threads_created / Connections)) * 100\fP
.br
When an application connects to a MySQL database, the database has to create a thread to manage the connection and the queries that will be sent in that connection. The database instructs the kernel to create a new thread, and the kernel allocates resources and creates the thread, then returns it to the MySQL service. When the connection is terminated by the application, MySQL tells the kernel to destroy the thread and free the resources. This create/destroy mechanism causes considerable overhead if the MySQL server has many new connections per second.
.br
If MySQL doesn't destroy the thread when the connection is terminated, but reuses it and assigns it to the next connection then this will decrease the kernel overhead. This is why a high \fBThread Cache Hit Rate\fP improves MySQL performance and decreases the system's CPU usage.
.br
Setting the parameter \fIthread_cache_size\fP in the \fImy.cnf\fP file accordingly will help to correctly balance between having a great thread cache and keeping MySQL memory consumption reasonable.
.br
Higher is better.
.P
\fBQuery Cache Hit Rate\fP
.br
\fBQcache_hits / (Qcache_hits + Com_select) * 100\fP
.br
Higher should be considered better.
.br
A query cache size increase is recommended if the query cache usage is very close to 100% and the query cache hit rate is far from 100%. But sometimes a size increase will not lead to a better hit rate: this means that the increase was not needed and that the application do not run enough cacheable SELECT queries.
.br
This value should grow proportionally with the number of executed queries as long as the query cache is performing well. Please also have a look at the \fBQuery cache usage\fP percentage to know if your query_cache configuration is appropriate.
.P
For more information please refer to http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/3808841/Optimizing-the-MySQL-Query-Cache.htm
.P
\fBQuery Cache Usage\fP
.br
\fB(1 - (Qcache_free_memory / query_cache_size)) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fIquery_cache_size\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBConnections Usage\fP
.br
\fB(Max_used_connections / max_connections) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fImax_connections\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBKey Buffer Usage\fP
.br
\fB(Key_blocks_used / (Key_blocks_used + Key_blocks_unused)) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fIkey_buffer_size\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBInnoDB Buffer Pool Usage\fP
.br
\fB(1 - (Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_free / Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total)) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fIinnodb_buffer_pool_size\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBTemp. Tables To Disk\fP
.br
\fB(Created_temp_disk_tables / Created_temp_disk_tables + Created_temp_tables)) * 100\fP
.br
During operation, MySQL has to create some temporary tables (that can be explicit, so created by the web application, or implicit, so for example MySQL has to create one when he runs some "SELECT DISTINCT", "UNION" or "VIEW" queries). MySQL will prefer to save this tmp tables to memory, for a fast access. But if \fItmp_table_size\fP gets saturated, he has to write them on the disk instead, making the access slower.
.br
Note that if you modify the value of \fItmp_table_size\fP in the MySQL configuration file, you should also modify the value of \fImax_heap_table_size\fP as well, since both values should have the same value because MySQL uses the minimum of both, so raising one of them is useless.
.br
Therefore this value helps to know how many tmp tables go to the disk instead than to the memory. Keep in mind that some large queries, involving TEXT and BLOB columns, are directly written to the disk instead than to the memory, because they would be too big. So you probably will want to avoid having a high % of tmp tables written to the disk, but you will never reach 0% on a big site, and this is fine.
.br
Lower is better ... but 0% is not reachable and you should not try to reach it, usually.
