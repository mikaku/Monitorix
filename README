INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================
Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool designed
to monitor as many services and system resources as possible. It has been
created to be used under production Linux/UNIX servers, but due to its
simplicity and small size may also be used to monitor embedded devices as
well.

It consists mainly of two programs: a collector, called monitorix, which
is a Perl daemon that is started automatically like any other system service,
and a CGI script called monitorix.cgi. Since 3.0 version Monitorix includes its
own HTTP server built in, so you don't need to install any web server to use it.

Every time 'monitorix' is started it reads the configuration file from the path
specified in the command line (using the -c option), and once checked, it
creates the 'index.html' file that will act as the Monitorix main page.

It also creates a file called '<base_dir>/cgi/monitorix.conf.path' that
includes the absolute path of the configuration file. This file will be read
by 'monitorix.cgi' to determine the exact location of the configuration file.

Please, see the monitorix.conf(5) and monitorix(8) man pages.


HISTORY
===============================================================================
All of its development was initially created for monitoring Red Hat, Fedora and
CentOS Linux systems, so this project was made keeping in mind these type of
distributions. Today it runs on different GNU/Linux distributions and even in
other UNIX systems, like FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.

On March 2006, Monitorix included minimal support to run on FreeBSD systems. My
special thanks to twenty4help Knowledge Service and to Roger "Rocky" Vetterberg
for their support and help, and for being good friends during the porting
process. 

Since the release of 1.3.2 though, Monitorix has almost full support for
FreeBSD. My special thanks to Pavlin Vatev who generously offered his support
during all of the process.

With the release 2.0.0 Monitorix suffered a complete rewrite, including new
features and graphs, cleaned up all the code, updated and enhanced a number of
aspects in some graphs, and fixed a lot of bugs. The most important change was
that it no longer required 'crond' to work, instead Monitorix became a complete
standalone Perl daemon being started and stopped like any other system service.

Since the release 2.2.0 Monitorix includes support for OpenBSD systems. My
special thanks to Devio.us team for giving me a free shell account where to put
hands to work.

Since the release 2.6.0 Monitorix includes support for NetBSD systems.

With the release of the 3.0.0 version, Monitorix suffered another large rewrite
which became into a complete modular code structure reducing in some cases
its memory footprint. That new version also included a number of new features,
cleaned up all the code, fixed a lot of bugs and had a safer code as it used
'strict' and 'warnings' in all its modules.

With this new modular structure, Monitorix can now be packaged either into a
single one package requiring all its dependences to be satisfied during the
installation, or into several small packages one for each graph which should
reduce notably its memory footprint.

Another interesting new feature in 3.0.0 version is that Monitorix comes with
its own HTTP server built in. This should satisfy all the people that don't want
to install an HTTP server (Apache, Nginx, lighttpd, etc.) to see the Monitorix
graphs.


REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================
Monitorix requires some others packages to be installed that your GNU/Linux
distribution may or may not have:

- Perl
- Perl-CGI
- Perl-libwww
- Perl-MailTools
- Perl-MIME-Lite
- Perl-DBI
- Perl-XML-Simple
- Perl-XML-LibXML
- Perl-Config-General
- Perl-HTTP-Server-Simple
- perl-IO-Socket-SSL
- RRDtool and its Perl bindings (perl-rrdtool or rrdtool-perl)
- (Optional) a CGI capable Web server (Apache, Nginx, lighttpd, etc.)


INSTALLATION
===============================================================================
Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to the file 
system. Most users will want to select from three options depending on target 
init system (do not run all four)!

	# make install-systemd-all
	# make install-upstart-all
	# make install-debian-all
	# make install-redhat-all

Alternatively, users may override any of the in make targets.  For example:

	$ make DESTDIR=~/pub BASEDIR=/srv/http/monitorix install-systemd-all

The file tree for the Monitorix application is:

Once succesfully installed, please take a look into the configuration file to
setup the options according your system and enable or disable graphs.

Finally start Monitorix using the system init script:

# service monitorix start

or with:

# /etc/init.d/monitorix start

At this point, Monitorix will start gathering the system information based on
the configuration setup in 'monitorix.conf', and after some minutes, you should
be able to see the results from your favorite browser pointing at:

http://localhost:8080/monitorix/
